What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git file containing the metadata. No commits are initialized.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a buffer for what you're going to commit. The working directory is the directory you're working out of (the directory with .git). The staging area let's you specify exactly which files you want to commit.
