What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git file containing the metadata. No commits are initialized.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a buffer for what you're going to commit. The working directory is the directory you're working out of (the directory with .git). The staging area let's you specify exactly which files you want to commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can check to see which files are being changed in the staging area.
You can also use git diff --staged to compare the difference between the most recent commit and the staging area.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you wanted to try an experimental feature, or develop for another language. This allows you to switch between branches and develop simultaneously with little effort.
