What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git file containing the metadata. No commits are initialized.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a buffer for what you're going to commit. The working directory is the directory you're working out of (the directory with .git). The staging area let's you specify exactly which files you want to commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can check to see which files are being changed in the staging area.
You can also use git diff --staged to compare the difference between the most recent commit and the staging area.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They show you where the branches fork from each other.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

You merge the other branch onto the branch that you've currently checked out. 
Both of those commits then become the parents of the new commit resulting from the merge.


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
