When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You want to create a remote repository when you want to push/pull it to GitHub to share.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You'll have more control over which commit you want to work on.
If you allow Git to automatically pull changes, it might pull changes that you don't want.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a Github clone of a repository already on Github. You'd use one when you don't have permission to alter the master, but would like to work off of someone else's version.

A clone is an exact copy of a repository. You can clone from Github to your local directory or from your local directory to your local directory as well.

A branch is when there is a non-linear geometry in the graph of your repository. You would use this when you want to try out experimental features.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can compare the differences between the last known state of the remote and your current master.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You could e-mail each other or use a file-sharing app like Dropbox.
It would be easier to automatically send files.
It would be much more difficult to keep track of versions.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Whenever you're collaborating with multiple people.
This allows people to review your work before merging it with the master.
