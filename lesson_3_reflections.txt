When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You want to create a remote repository when you want to push/pull it to GitHub to share.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You'll have more control over which commit you want to work on.
If you allow Git to automatically pull changes, it might pull changes that you don't want.
